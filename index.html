        This video shows the devastating impact of human-caused fires on wildlife. Richard Rasmussen and his team found an otter severely burned and suffering, struggling to survive amidst the flames. Despite their efforts to rescue and care for the animal, it tragically did not survive. The video challenges us to reflect on our role in protecting nature and its vulnerable inhabitants.
